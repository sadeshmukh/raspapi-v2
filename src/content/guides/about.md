RaspAPI is a YSWS where you build an API, log your hours with [Hackatime](https://hackatime.hackclub.com), and get a Raspberry Pi Zero 2W to host it. This site has a handful of starter guides to get you get going.

- Read the [**Building**](./building) guides to make your API.
- Use the [**Hosting**](./hosting) guides to deploy your API.

Missing any guides? Feel free to contribute to the repo or open an issue with the tag `docs`.

# Submission Requirements

Before submitting your project, make sure you meet the following requirements:

- Your API should be publicly accessible on the internet with a URL (no ephemeral links, please!)
- Your API should have at least 3 GET endpoints and 1 POST endpoint.
- Your API should include docs at `/docs` or at root. These can be handwritten or auto-generated (Swagger, Redoc, Scalar, etc.), but should clearly explain your endpoints and give an example of a valid request for each.
- Your API should be usable by anyone. If it requires auth or API keys, make sure there's a way for people to easily get access, such as with a demo key on your docs.
- Your code should be in a public git repo with a README explaining what it is.
- You must have tracked 7 or more hours on Hackatime.
- Make something cool and have fun!
