RaspAPI is a YSWS where you build an API, log your hours with [Hackatime](https://hackatime.hackclub.com), and get a Raspberry Pi Zero 2W to host it. This site has a handful of starter guides to get you get going.

- Read the **Building** guides to make your API.
- Use the **Hosting** guides to deploy your API.
