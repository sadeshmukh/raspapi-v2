RaspAPI is a YSWS where you build an API, log your hours with [Hackatime](https://hackatime.hackclub.com), and get a Raspberry Pi Zero 2W to host it. This site contains all the guides you need to build your API before you receive your Pi.

- Read the **Building** guides to create your API in your favorite language.
- Use the **Hosting** guides to test and prepare your API for deployment.

Once you submit and receive your Pi, you'll get additional deployment instructions.
